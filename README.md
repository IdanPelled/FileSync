# FileSync

FileSync is a file synchronization software that allows users to synchronize their local files across devices in the cloud. The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use and reliable solution to keep users' important files and documents synchronized. With FileSync, users can easily configure synchronization settings for a specific folder, and the program will automatically upload changes to the remote storage when there are modifications to the local file. This ensures that the user's data is always up to date, regardless of which computer they access it from. The software features a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of configuring and managing synchronization settings.

## Features

- Synchronize local files to the cloud: FileSync allows users to sync their local files to a remote server, ensuring that the files are securely backed up and accessible from any device.
- Easy configuration: Users can easily configure synchronization settings for specific folders, specifying the frequency of synchronization and other options.
- Automatic synchronization: FileSync continuously monitors the specified folders for changes and automatically uploads any modifications to the remote storage, ensuring that the files are always up to date.
- Customized protocol: FileSync uses a custom protocol specifically designed for efficient file synchronization. The protocol includes a token generated by the server and sent to the client upon successful authentication. The token is required for the server to identify the user's computer when attempting to synchronize files.
- Bidirectional synchronization: When changes are made on one client's computer, the files are sent to the server. When another client's computer accesses the server, it downloads the updated version, ensuring synchronization across different devices.

## Components

FileSync consists of the following components:

1. **Server**: The server component is written in Python and runs on a Linux computer. It handles client requests, authentication, and file synchronization.
2. **User Interface**: The user interface is a Python-based application designed for user authentication, registration, and synchronization settings management.
3. **Windows Service**: The Windows service component, written in C++, communicates with the server and handles the synchronization of files on the client's computer.
